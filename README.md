# Docker Nym

This repository provides Docker images for Nym. Images are built on tag using a GitHub Workflow (see its [source code](https://github.com/louneskmt/docker-nym/blob/main/.github/workflows/on-tag.yml) and [runs](https://github.com/louneskmt/docker-nym/actions)).

All images are uploaded automatically to my Docker Hub account:
- [Nym Mixnode image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/louneskmt/nym-mixnode)
- [Nym Gateway image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/louneskmt/nym-gateway)

# Nym Mixnode
On first startup, the mixnode will be automatically initiated with your configuration. You'll need to follow [these instructions](https://nymtech.net/docs/run-nym-nodes/mixnodes/#claim-your-mixnode-in-telegram-so-you-can-get-tokens) to claim your node.

You can either run this container using [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/), or as a standlone container.

In both cases, create a directory to contain all your Nym mixnode data:
```shell
$ mkdir -p nym-mixnode/data
$ sudo chmod 777 -R nym-mixnode/data
$ cd nym-mixnode
```

The details you will need to claim and bond your node are available in the container logs:
```shell
$ docker-compose logs
OR
$ docker logs nym-mixnode
```

## Setup IPv6
In order for your node to support IPv6 (which is mandatory if you don't want to loose reputation on the network), you will need to configure Docker. As Docker doesn't support well IPv6, we'll use an IPv6 NAT container. More info [here](https://github.com/robbertkl/docker-ipv6nat).

First, create a new Docker IPv6 subnet:

```shell
$ docker network create --ipv6 --subnet="fdc4:f42f:270c:1a84::/64" nym_ipv6_network
```

Replace `fdc4:f42f:270c:1a84::/64` by another random CID generated on
https://simpledns.plus/private-ipv6.

Then, create the NAT container.

```shell
$ docker pull robbertkl/ipv6nat
$ docker run -d \
         --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
         --cap-add=NET_RAW \
         --cap-add=SYS_MODULE \
         --cap-drop=ALL \
         --name="IPv6NAT" \
         --network=host \
         --restart=unless-stopped \
         --volume="/lib/modules:/lib/modules:ro" \
         --volume="/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro" \
         robbertkl/ipv6nat
```

## Example

### Compose file example (prefered method):
Create a `docker-compose.yml` file under the `nym-mixnode` directory.

```yml
version: '3.7'

services:
  mixnode:
    image: louneskmt/nym-mixnode:v0.10.1
    container_name: nym-mixnode
    stop_signal: SIGINT
    ulimits:
      nproc: 65535
    ports:
      - "1789:1789"
    volumes:
      - $PWD/data:/data
    environment:
      NYM_ID: "mixnode"
      NYM_HOST: "172.20.0.3"
      NYM_PORT: "1789"
      NYM_ANNOUNCE_HOST: "X:X:X:X"
      NYM_ANNOUNCE_PORT: "1789"
      NYM_TELEGRAM_USER: "@username"
    networks:
      nym:
        ipv4_address: 172.20.0.3
      nym_ipv6:

networks:
  nym:
    name: nym_network
    ipam:
      driver: default
      config:
        - subnet: "172.20.0.0/16"
  nym_ipv6:
    name: nym_ipv6_network
```

To start your Nym mixnode, go to the `nym-mixnode` directory, where `docker-compose.yml` is located, and execute:

```shell
$ docker-compose up -d
```

### As a standlone container (not well tested):
```shell
$ cd nym-mixnode
$ docker network create --subnet=172.20.0.0/16 nym_network
$ docker create \
         -v $PWD/data:/data \
         -p "1789:1789" \
         -e 'NYM_ID=mixnode' \
         -e 'NYM_HOST=172.20.0.3' \
         -e 'NYM_PORT=1789' \
         -e 'NYM_ANNOUNCE_HOST=213.136.91.13' \
         -e 'NYM_ANNOUNCE_PORT=1789' \
         -e 'NYM_TELEGRAM_USER="@username"' \
         --ulimit "nproc=65535" \
         --stop-signal "SIGINT" \
         --network "nym_network" \
         --ip "172.20.0.3" \
         --name "nym-mixnode" \
         louneskmt/nym-mixnode:v0.10.1
$ docker network connect nym_ipv6_network nym-mixnode
$ docker start nym-mixnode
```
